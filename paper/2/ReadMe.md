## (ii) Keywords

  * (ii1)**Requirements Tracability** : It defines the ability to track down the life of a requirement back to its source documents. 
  The source documents can range from databases, spreadsheets, flat files etc.
  * (ii2)**Information Search** : Information search refers to retrieving relevant information using various sources. Its a part of
  consumer decision process where a consumer looks for internal or external information(wiki).
  * (ii3)**Machine Learning** : Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make 
  predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or 
  decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions(wiki).
  * (ii4)**Web Mining**  : Web mining is the use of data mining techniques to automatically discover and extract information from 
  Web documents and services(wiki).
