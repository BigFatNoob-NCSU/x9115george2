## (ii) Keywords

  * (ii1)**Requirements Tracability** : It defines the ability to track down the life of a requirement back to its source documents. 
  The source documents can range from databases, spreadsheets, flat files etc.
  * (ii2)**Information Search** : Information search refers to retrieving relevant information using various sources. Its a part of
  consumer decision process where a consumer looks for internal or external information(wiki).
  * (ii3)**Machine Learning** : Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make 
  predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or 
  decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions(wiki).
  * (ii4)**Web Mining**  : Web mining is the use of data mining techniques to automatically discover and extract information from 
  Web documents and services(wiki).

## (iii) Artifacts
  * (iii1) **Motivation** : Current methods for checking requirements compliance rely on standard software engineering practices of requirements traceablity which is the ability to track a requirement from its origins back to its rationale and downstream to various work products that implement that requirement in software. Manual tracing can be prohibitively time-consuming; however automated trace retrieval methods are not very effective due to the vocabulary mismatches that often occur between regulatory codes and product level requirements. Current(upto 2010) studies show that organizations struggle to implement successful and cost-effective traceability, primarily because creating, maintaining, and using traces is a time-consuming, costly, arduous, and error prone activity. Moreover efficient information retrieval and data mining techniques have not been explored based on the literature which leaves an avenue open.
