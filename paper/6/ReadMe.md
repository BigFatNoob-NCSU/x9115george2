## (ii) Keywords

  * (ii1)**Requirements** : A requirement in product development and process optimization is a singular documented physical and functional need that a particular design, product or process must be able to perform.
  * (ii2)**Information Search** : Information search refers to retrieving relevant information using various sources. Its a part of consumer decision process where a consumer looks for internal or external information(wiki).
  * (ii3)**Clustering** : Clustering is an unsupervised learning method which automatically divides data into natural groups based on similarity.
  * (ii4)**Traceability** : Traceability is the ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification(wiki).  

## (iii) Artifacts
  * (iii1) **Motivation** :
    * Due to the inherent trade-off between recall and pre- cision, information retrieval methods cannot achieve a high coverage without also retrieving a great number of false positives, causing a significant drop in result accuracy.
    * Traceability has since been shown to be critical for a wide variety of software engineering activities, including verification and validation (V&V), risk assessment, and change impact analysis. However, practitioners often fail to implement consistent and effective traceability processes if the traces are maintained manually.
    * Currently, IR-based tracing tools favor recall over pre- cision. This is mainly because commission errors (false positives) are easier to deal with than omission errors (false negatives). However, retrieving an excessive number of links can seriously affect the practicality of such tools.
    * The overarching goal of the proposed method is to capture all potential correct traceability links and incorrect ones.
  * (iii2) **Hypotheses** : 
    * Clustering will be able to group correct and incorrect links can be grouped in high-quality and low-quality links respectively. Thus, the performance of IR-based tracing can be enhanced by selecting candidate links from high-quality clusters.
    * The problem of consistency and effectiveness can be overcome by automatic generation of traceability links by exploiting Information Retrieval methods like Vector Space Model, Probablistic Network Model adn Latent Semantic Indexing.
    * The proposed method advances the fundamental understanding about the role clustering plays in traceability, but also enables principled ways to increase the practicality of automated tracing tools.
