## (ii) Keywords

  * (ii1)**Requirements Tracability** : It defines the ability to track down the life of a requirement back to its source documents. The source documents can range from databases, spreadsheets, flat files etc.
  * (ii2)**Information Search** : Information search refers to retrieving relevant information using various sources. Its a part of consumer decision process where a consumer looks for internal or external information(wiki).
  * (ii3)**Object Orientation** : Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods(wiki).
  * (ii4)**Program Comprehension**  :  Program comprehension is a vital software engineering and maintenance activity. It is necessary to facilitate reuse, inspection, maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering, migration, and extension of existing software systems

## (iii) Artifacts
  * (iii1) **Motivation** :
    * Traceability links between areas of code and related sections of free text documents, such as an application domain handbook, a specification document, a set of design documents, or manual pages, aid both top-down and bottom-up comprehension.
    * Traceability links between code and other sources of information are a sensible help to perform the combined analysis of heterogeneous information and, ultimately, to associate domain concepts with code fragments.
    * Traceability links between the requirement specification document and the code are a key to locate the areas of code that contribute to implement specific user functionality. This helps assess the completeness of an implementation with respect to stated requirements, to devise complete and comprehensive test cases, and to infer requirement coverage from structure
coverage during testing. Traceability links between requirements and code can also help to identify the code areas directly affected by a maintenance request as stated by an end user
    * A major goal of impact analysis is the identification of the work products affected by a proposed change.
    * Means to trace code to free text documents are a sensible help to locate reuse-candidate components.
