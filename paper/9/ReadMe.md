## (ii) Keywords

  * (ii1)**Requirements** : A requirement in product development and process optimization is a singular documented physical and functional need that a particular design, product or process must be able to perform.
  * (ii2)**Expert System** : Expert systems are part of a general category of computer applications known as artificial intelligence . To design an expert system, one needs a knowledge engineer, an individual who studies how human experts make decisions and translates the rules into terms that a computer can understand.
  * (ii3)**Domain Ontology** : A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) represents concepts which belong to part of the world. Particular meanings of terms applied to that domain are provided by domain ontology. Since domain ontologies represent concepts in very specific and often eclectic ways, they are often incompatible.
  * (ii4)**Traceability** : Traceability is the ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification(wiki).  

## (iii) Artifacts
  * (iii1) **Motivation** : Vast majority of relevant work in the past decade has been focused at the lowest level of the Traceability Intelligence Quotient (tIQ) and posit that achieving high quality automated traceability will require re-focusing research efforts on the development of more intelligent algorithms ca- pable of reasoning about concepts, their relationships and constraints, and the contexts in which they occur. Traditional approaches to traceability, including those integrated into most commercial tools, assume that users will create and maintain trace links manually. Unfortunately, the tracing task is arduous and error-prone and therefore in practice even the most basic trace links are often inaccurate, incomplete, and ambiguous.
  * (iii2) **Hypotheses** : Information retrieval techniques are used to compute similarity scores (or link probabilities) between pairs of source and target artifacts, such as between requirements and code, or between regulations and requirements, and then to present high-scoring pairs as candidate links to users. Tha authors propose a classification scheme which identifies various degrees of intelligence exhibited by text- centric trace creation algorithms and posit that continued efforts to achieve high degrees of automation will require focusing our efforts on developing more intelligent tracing solutions. They choose to focus purely on text-based tech- niques because these are a core component of almost every automated, or semi-automated tracing algorithm.
