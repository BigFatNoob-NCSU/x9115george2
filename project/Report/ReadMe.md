# Py* : Python Based Modelling Module For Requirements Engineering
#### - George Mathew (george2@ncsu.edu)

## Abstract
In early phase of software development, mapping functional requirements are critical
since this gives a high level insight on the feasibility of the software. UML diagrams
were used initially for modelling, but UML often focuses on organisational objects,
which are not so important in the early phase, when the emphasis should be on helping
stakeholders gain better understanding of the various possibilities for using information
systems in their organizations. The i* model was proposed in 2005 to provide an early
understanding of the organizational relationships in a business domain. The Use Case
development from organizational modeling using i* allows requirement engineers to
establish a relationship between the functional requirements of the intended system
and the organizational goals. Constructing these models using the current state of the
art (OpenOME developed in 2008) is cumbersome, time consuming and makes it hard
to perform predictive analysis and optimization on the models. In this project a simple
python based module is proposed which can be easily used to create and update the
models by the business user based on his requirements. At the same time Py* also
reduces the effort of the requirements engineer to predict the outcome of the models
and optimize for its feasibility
